# Submitting Challenges

Create an account on [c0d3.com/signup](http://c0d3.com/signup) if you don't
already have one.

For most of the steps below, you will be typing the commands into the
**terminal**.

These steps are the same set of instructions you will most likely follow at
work. Each challenge you solve is simulating building a feature at work.

If this is all new to you, these steps may seem very intimidating. When you
start a new job, you will be equally intimidated because of all the specific
tools each company uses. It is important to ask questions when you feel
overwhelmed, there will be people on the chatroom help answer your questions.

## Local Setup

When you join a software engineering company, the first step is setting up your
machine, downloading the codebase, and setting up the codebase.
([video instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnRgR7z0rFU&t=254s))

1. After installing `node`, install c0d3 CLI (used to submit challenges):
   `npm i -g c0d3`

   - If you run into a `Missing write access ... EACCES` error, you need to run
     npm with sudo:
     - `sudo npm i -g c0d3`

1. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
   and familiarize yourself with [common git commands](/docs/git)
1. Use git to [clone the curriculum](https://github.com/garageScript/curriculum)
   into your machine
   - `git clone [https://github.com/garageScript/curriculum](https://github.com/garageScript/curriculum)`
1. Go into the curriculum root folder by typing `cd curriculum`
1. Download the necessary libraries by running `yarn install`

## Browser Setup

1. Go to
   [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/garageScript/curriculum).
   You'll be asked to create an account or you can also login using a Github
   account.
2. After your workspace is created, you'll have most of the tools you need at
   your disposal (`git`, `node`, `npm` and `yarn`). You'll need to install only
   the c0d3 CLI tool used to submit the challenges, by typing `npm i -g c0d3` on
   the terminal at the bottom of the screen. **Note:** every time your workspace
   is restarted you'll need to run this command again.
3. After installing the CLI tool, type `c0d3 login` and enter your C0D3 account
   credentials to be able to submit the challenges.
4. Now the only thing remaining is to download the necessary libraries by
   running `yarn install`.

## Solving Challenges

`git status` is your best friend. It tells you what branch you are currently on
and which files are changed and/or staged for commit.

Solving each challenge is like building a feature at work. You must always
checkout `checkout master` before creating a new branch to work on a new
feature.

Branch names: Usually branch names are for your own eyes only, so you do not
have create branches with meaningful names.

_Note: Except for steps 3 (reading the challenge) and 4 (open and editing the
file), all the commands should be run in the terminal_

1. Make sure you are on the master branch: `git checkout master`
2. Create a new branch from master (pro tip: `p1` for problem 1)
   - `git checkout -b p1`
3. Go to [c0d3.com](http://c0d3.com), click on Curriculum, select lesson 0, and
   read challenge 1
4. Write the solution by opening, editing, and saving `js0/1.js` (means file
   _1.js_ inside folder _js0_)
5. Test your file by running `npm run test`. (Make sure tests are passing 100%)
   - You will have to type `q` or `CTRL c` to get out of the test script
6. Add and commit changed files. **Do not commit `package-lock.json` file**

   - `git add js0/1.js` → stages the file to be saved
   - `git commit -m "solves problem 1"` → saves the changes

     - If you forget to put `-m`, you will be put into vim. To get out, type
       `:wq` to save and exit.
     - The commit message (the text that comes after `-m`) should be present
       tense and describe what the change does.

     If you do `git status` and see changes to the file `package-lock.json` or
     `yarn-lock.json`, you would also commit these changes at work. These files
     lock in the version of the libraries used to run your files. However, to
     make reviews for your submission easier, **do not commit** changes to these
     files.

7. Submit your solution: `c0d3 submit`
   - Note: You will be prompted to choose the exact lesson and challenge you are
     currently submitting. You should select lesson 0 and problem 1.
   - Go back to your student page (c0d3.com → Curriculum → lesson 0), refresh
     it, and see the solution you just submitted! :)
8. Go back to **step 1** and repeat for the next challenge.

Make sure you go back to STEP 1 and run `git checkout master` so you are on
master branch before creating a new branch so you can start the next problem
fresh. If you don't then you will be creating a new branch from existing branch
and all your solutions will be piled up together.

**If you accidentally made a commit to your `master` branch, you need to undo
the commit.**

1. Undo the last commit: `git reset HEAD~`
2. Go to the branch for your problem (we will use `p1` as an example)
   - If the branch does not exist, you need to create one
     - `git checkout -b p1`
   - If the branch exists, you can just switch to it (by omitting the `-b`
     option)
     - `git checkout p1`
3. Continue with step 6 and onwards (add and commit)

## Getting Feedback

As a software engineer, after submitting a feature you will wait for other
software engineers to review your code.

Similarly, after submitting your solution, your solution will be reviewed by
other engineers to make sure you are following best practices in your code.

You should be able to see your submissions when you go to
[c0d3.com](http://c0d3.com), click on Curriculum, and select lesson 0.

It can take some time for a mentor to review your code. Feel free to go to
[JS0-Foundations chatroom](https://chat.c0d3.com/c0d3/channels/js0-foundations)
to request a review.

If your code is not following best practices, your submission will get rejected.
The following steps will help you resubmit.

_Example_: Problem 5 is rejected.

1. Go to the branch that has the commit for problem 5: `git checkout p5` (if
   your branch was called p5)
2. Open and edit the file `js0/5.js` and address the comment you received
3. Add and commit changed files
   - `git add js0/5.js` → stages the file to be saved
   - `git commit -m "fixes problem 5 suggestion"` → saves the changes
4. Submit your solution again: `c0d3 submit`

## Completing your submission

As a software engineer, you need to merge your code back into your `master`
branch after the code has been approved.

When **all of your submissions** have been approved, you need to follow these
steps: ([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzZqwUXIc00))

1. Go to the master branch: `git checkout master`.
   - If you have done this correctly, you will notice that all of the your
     solutions are missing. This is because your solutions are on different
     branches and we need to merge them in.
2. Merge your branch containing the solution to problem 1 (we will use `p1` as
   example) into your existing (master) branch:
   - `git merge p1`
   - By doing this, `master` branch will now have your solution to challenge 1.
3. Merge your branch containing problem 2 solution (we will be using `p2` as an
   example) into your existing (master) branch:
   - `git merge p2`
   - By doing this, `master` branch will now have your solution to challenge 2.
4. Continue merging the remaining branches into `master`.
   - At this point, `master` should have all the approved solutions to all the
     challenges in this lesson.
