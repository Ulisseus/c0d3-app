# Setup Instructions

<br />

## Code Editor

You can choose any editor you want VS Code, WebStorm IDE, Sublime Text or even
Vim.

We recommend using VS Code. [Install](https://code.visualstudio.com/) VS Code.

## Creating a File

1. Launch VS Code. Type **code** in command line interface prompt or search bar
   (the most common CLI [commands](/docs/cli)).

> **Pro tip**: In the terminal, you can simply type `code .` to launch VS Code
> in the current folder. To set up this terminal shortcut in macOS, open up VS
> Code, and use `cmd + shift + p` to open Search. Type in `shell`, and install
> the 'code' command.

2. Use your code editor to write some JavaScript code. Type the following:

   ```jsx
   a = 'hello'
   console.log(a)
   ```

3. Save your file as `test.js` in any folder you decide.

## Running JavaScript Codes On Computer

Now that you have your code, you need to run it with a program called
**`node.js`**.

1. Download the latest stable version of [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), **a
   program to run JavaScript**. If you're using Windows install
   [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
   first and follow instructions for Linux from now on.

   1. For companies that use `node`, the best practice is to use
      [nvm](`https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm`) to install node.js.
   1. [Install nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
   1. use `nvm` to install node version 14 by typing into your terminal:
      `nvm i 14`.

   [Installing NodeJS on ChromeBook](/docs/chromebook).

1. Open your terminal and use `cd` to go to the folder that contains your file.
1. Run your file using node: `node test.js`.
1. You should see the output `hello`.

## Browser-based setup

If you don't want to install node locally you use run javascript code in your
browser. Go to
[GitPod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/garageScript/curriculum). You'll
be asked to create an account or you can also login using a Github account.

## Running HTML Codes on the Browser

Sometimes, you want to test something really quick and you are simply too lazy
to create a new file. You can also write some quick code on the browser and
immediately run it.

1. Open your browser, then right-click on the browser, then click on
   `Inspect Element` or `Inspect` (Firefox and Chrome).

2. In the screen that appears, click on the `Console` tab:

<Image height={448} width={1444} src={'/assets/docs/setup/console.png'} />

3. After that, you can start typing code! For now, type `console.log("hello")`.
   And then type enter key.

4. To write code on multiple lines, you must type Shift + Enter (only Enter for
   Windows).

Alternatively, you can run node directly from terminal. Type `node` to start
node REPL (read–eval–print loop).

## Running HTML Codes from VS Code

Once you have completed writing and saving your HTML codes on a file name
xxxx.html, you are ready to run the html codes on a browser. The easiest way is
to run the codes directly from VS Code. However, before you can run the html
codes, you will need to install the **_open in browser_** extension by
**_techER._**

Launch VS Code.

For Mac users: Click on **Code** → **Preferences** → **Extensions**. Or use
[**shift**] + [**command**] + [**x**] keys.

For window users: Click on **File** → **Preferences** → **Extensions**. Or use
[**Ctrl**] + [**Shift**] + [**X**] keys.

Enter **open in browser** in search box, and then select **open in browser** by
**techER**. Install the extension.

While you are in VS Code, edit your html file. For window users, **right click**
and select **View in Browser.** For Mac users, press [**control**] key and
**click** and select **Open in Default Browser,** or press [**option**]+[**B**]
keys.

Your default browser will be launched with your html file running.

# Next Step

Congratulations! You have written your first JavaScript program and you know how
to run code directly in the browser. Now you are ready to start your journey.
