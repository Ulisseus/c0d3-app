# Setup Instructions

Now that you know your way around the terminal, you can start setting up your computer to write some code.

## Code Editor 

We will use VS Code (Visual Studio Code) for code editing. 
[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a open source-code editor for macOS, Linux, and Windows. 
[Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

If you get a server provisioned for you, you can setup VSCode to code remotely.

## Creating a File

1. Launch VS Code.  For Windows, type **code** in command prompt or search bar.

  >**Pro tip**: In the terminal, you can simply type `code .` to launch VS Code in the current folder. 
  For macOS, look below to see how to set it up. 

  To set up this terminal shortcut in macOS, open up VS Code, and use `cmd + shift + p` to open Search. 
  Type in `shell`, and install the 'code' command.

2. Use your code editor to write some JavaScript code. Type the following:

    ```jsx
    a = "hello"
    console.log(a)
    ```

3. Save your file as `test.js` in any folder you decide.O

## Running JavaScript Codes On Computer

Now that you have your code, you need to run it with a program called **`node.js`**.

1. Download the latest stable version of [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), **a program to run JavaScript**.
  1. For companies that use `node`, the best practice is to use [nvm](`https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm`) to install node.js.
        1. [Install nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
        2. use `nvm` to install node version 10 by typing into your terminal:

            `nvm i 10` 

2. Open your terminal and use `cd` to go to the folder that contains your file. 
3. Run your file using node: `node test.js`  
4. You should see the output `hello`

## Running HTML Codes on the Browser

Sometimes, you want to test something really quick and you are simply too lazy to create a new file. You can also write some quick code on the browser and immediately run it. 

1. Open your browser, then right-click on the browser, then click on `Inspect Element`  or `Inspect`:

    ### Firefox and Chrome

    ![inspect](/assets/curriculum/lessons/devSetup/inspect.png)

2.  In the screen that appears, click on the `Console` tab:

    ![console](/assets/curriculum/lessons/devSetup/console.png)
3.  After that, you can start typing code! For now, type `console.log("hello")`. And then type enter key:

4. To write code on multiple lines, you must type Shift + Enter (only Enter for Windows):

    ![lines](/assets/curriculum/lessons/devSetup/lines.png)
## Running HTML Codes from VS Code

Once you have completed writing and saving your HTML codes on a file name xxxx.html, you are ready to run the html codes on a browser.  The easiest way is to run the codes directly from VS Code.  However, before you can run the html codes, you will need to install the ***open in browser*** extension by ***techER.*** 

Launch VS Code.

For Mac users: Click on **Code** → **Preferences** → **Extensions**. Or use [**shift**] + [**command**] + [**x**] keys.  

For window users: Click on **File** → **Preferences** → **Extensions**. Or use  [**Ctrl**] + [**Shift**] + [**X**] keys.

Enter **open in browser** in search box, and then select **open in browser** by **techER**. Install the extension. 

While you are in VS Code, edit your html file. For window users, **right click** and select **View in Browser.**  For Mac users,  press [**control**] key and **click** and select **Open in Default Browser,** or press [**option**]+[**B**] keys.

Your default browser will be launched with your html file running.

# Next Step

Congratulations! You have written your first JavaScript program and you know how to run code directly in the browser. Now you are ready to start your journey.
